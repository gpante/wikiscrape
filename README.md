# wikiscrape
Quick demo of BeautifulSoup and Requests Python Packages

To run, download wikiscrape.py and uncomment the sections you wish to run via text editor or IDE. 
Each section is separated by horizontal lines:
* C02 Emissions by Country
* Best Selling Video Games
* Wizards of Waverly Place
* Countries by Area

Each sub-script will convert tabular data from the wikipedia page and input it into a Pandas dataframe which can further be manipulated and agregated.
